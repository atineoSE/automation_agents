It first opens Spotlight Search using Command+Space, types 'calculator' to open the app, then waits for it to launch. After the calculator opens, it types '2', presses the multiplication key (*), types '3', and presses return to get the result. The script includes deliberate pauses (using time.sleep()) to ensure each action completes before the next one begins. The PAUSE parameter is set to add a small delay between all PyAutoGUI functions for reliability."}
